  <h1>Sequence Models</h1>
  <p>This document provides in-depth notes on various Python concepts ranging from basic data types and operators to advanced topics such as sorting algorithms and file handling. Each section includes clear explanations, analogies where applicable, and code examples to help illustrate the concepts.</p>

    <h2>What is a Sequence?</h2>
    <p>A sequence is an ordered list of items. In the context of machine learning and AI, these items are often data points that depend on each other in some order ‚Äî like words in a sentence, stock prices over time, or audio signals.</p>
    <p>Examples:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Sentence: "<code>I love ChatGPT</code>" ‚Äî sequence of words</li>
      <li>Stock prices: Price on day 1, day 2, day 3, etc.</li>
      <li>Weather: Temperature recorded hourly</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <div class="analogy" id="seq_analogy">
    <p><strong>Imagine</strong> you have a string and you're carefully threading colorful beads onto it, one by one. Each bead you add is not random ‚Äî its color and placement depend on the beads that came before it. If you suddenly put a completely different or broken bead in the middle, the whole design looks odd. In the same way, a sequence is a series where the order matters. Just like a beautiful necklace depends on the proper arrangement of beads, a sentence or a musical tune depends on the proper sequence of words or notes. You can‚Äôt just place the last bead first or skip the middle ones ‚Äî every bead adds meaning step by step, just like in language, music, or time-series data where each step depends on the previous ones. This is the essence of a sequence ‚Äî a meaningful pattern built one piece at a time, where the past affects the future.</p>

    <h2>What are Sequence Models</h2>
    <p>Sequence models are machine learning models designed to understand, process, or generate data where the order matters.</p>
    <p>Unlike regular models that treat inputs independently, sequence models remember what came before and use that to make better predictions.</p>
    <p>They are specially built to handle sequential data, like:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Sentences (words in order)</li>
      <li>Time-series data (stock prices, weather)</li>
      <li>Audio (sound over time)</li>
      <li>Video frames (sequence of images)</li>
    </ul>
